       " Document(metadata={'source': './Data Ingestion/attention.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './Data Ingestion/attention.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nP E(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,P Epos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Instead, ‘emotional vampire’ is a term for those people in your life who somehow seem to sap your energy when you spend time with them – the friends who might complain a lot, demand you sit and listen to their problems, and never ask you about yourself.\\nTo discuss these draining relationships and what we can do about them, Anita Rani was joined on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour by psychologist and author Suzy Reading, and journalist Radhika Sanghani.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nListen to BBC Radio 4\\'s Woman\\'s Hour\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can we spot the signs of an ‘emotional vampire’? And what can we do to handle those relationships?\\n“I think it’s helpful to take a look at the things to be on the look out for”, says Suzy. “There are a few different characteristics - certainly an excessive need for attention, for validation, for reassurance. But there\\'s also a sense that nothing that occurs in their life is their fault.\\n\\n\\n“They\\'re often very slippery characters. And while there is this real focus on self, there\\'s also little awareness of the patterns, their behaviours, and how that impacts on other people. I\\'d also say that there\\'s little compassion for others in those moments.\\n“They may enjoy creating chaos but don\\'t want any feedback on that or any solutions in resolving the chaos, or they may just want to vent with no sense of interest in how that impacts on you. But it also manifests in some other ways. It might be that they chip away at your self-trust or self-belief by backhanded comments, or maybe there\\'s a real sense of toxic positivity where they deny you the right to express yourself.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, what can we do if we’re experiencing this with someone close to us – whether that’s a friend or even a family member?\\n\\n\\nSuzy and Radhika shared their advice with Anita...\\n1. Be direct about their behaviour\\n“We need to become skilled in giving feedback, in being direct and saying: ‘When you do X, this is how it feels’”, says Suzy. “Because otherwise that person goes through life noticing this atrophy of friends and they\\'ve got no idea why. There is an opportunity for growth.\\n“There are plenty of examples where people have been given that feedback and they\\'ve been aghast. They\\'ve had no idea about the impact their behaviour has had on other people. So, we need to get skilled and speak up. And then if there\\'s no change, then we need to take a look at what we need.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Communicate how you’re feeling\\n“What I\\'m trying to do, which I\\'m finding quite empowering, is finding the courage to say it out loud”, says Radhika. “I\\'m not saying: ‘I think you\\'re an emotional vampire’, I\\'m saying: ‘Look, I feel like lately when we\\'re hanging out, I\\'m not really feeling that there\\'s much space for me. I don\\'t feel heard. I\\'m not really being asked any questions.’\\n\\n\\n“Whatever it is, I\\'ll try to awkwardly find the courage to say it out loud. For me, a true friendship worth keeping and investing in is one where that person can hear me and have a conversation about it. If they instantly deny or are defensive, that to me shows they\\'re not someone I want in my life.”\\n3. Set boundaries\\n“I think where there\\'s no willingness or no desire to create change, we do need to protect ourselves”, says Suzy.\\n“Whether that’s refining boundaries or saying: ‘I\\'m sorry, I need to call time on this relationship’, we need to clearly articulate what it is that we need to feel safe and healthy in the relationship with that person.\\n“It\\'s a matter of taking a look at those warning signs and just observing: Where are you at? Where are your energy levels at? Let\\'s give ourselves permission to pace ourselves.\\n“So, it could be simple things like if you cannot extricate yourself from each other\\'s lives, there might be some boundaries around how we communicate.

Instead, ‘emotional vampire’ is a term for those people in your life who somehow seem to sap your energy when you spend time with them – the friends who might complain a lot, demand you sit and listen to their problems, and never ask you about yourself.To discuss these draining relationships and what we can do about them, Anita Rani was joined on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour by psychologist and author Suzy Reading, and journalist Radhika Sanghani.“I think it’s helpful to take a look at the things to be on the look out for”, says Suzy. “There are a few different characteristics - certainly an excessive need for attention, for validation, for reassurance. But there\\'s also a sense that nothing that occurs in their life is their fault.“They\\'re often very slippery characters. And while there is this real focus on self, there\\'s also little awareness of the patterns, their behaviours, and how that impacts on other people. I\\'d also say that there\\'s little compassion for others in those moments.“They may enjoy creating chaos but don\\'t want any feedback on that or any solutions in resolving the chaos, or they may just want to vent with no sense of interest in how that impacts on you. But it also manifests in some other ways. It might be that they chip away at your self-trust or self-belief by backhanded comments, or maybe there\\'s a real sense of toxic positivity where they deny you the right to express yourself.”So, what can we do if we’re experiencing this with someone close to us – whether that’s a friend or even a family member?Suzy and Radhika shared their advice with Anita...“We need to become skilled in giving feedback, in being direct and saying: ‘When you do X, this is how it feels’”, says Suzy. “Because otherwise that person goes through life noticing this atrophy of friends and they\\'ve got no idea why. There is an opportunity for growth.“There are plenty of examples where people have been given that feedback and they\\'ve been aghast. They\\'ve had no idea about the impact their behaviour has had on other people. So, we need to get skilled and speak up. And then if there\\'s no change, then we need to take a look at what we need.”“What I\\'m trying to do, which I\\'m finding quite empowering, is finding the courage to say it out loud”, says Radhika. “I\\'m not saying: ‘I think you\\'re an emotional vampire’, I\\'m saying: ‘Look, I feel like lately when we\\'re hanging out, I\\'m not really feeling that there\\'s much space for me. I don\\'t feel heard. I\\'m not really being asked any questions.’“Whatever it is, I\\'ll try to awkwardly find the courage to say it out loud. For me, a true friendship worth keeping and investing in is one where that person can hear me and have a conversation about it. If they instantly deny or are defensive, that to me shows they\\'re not someone I want in my life.”“I think where there\\'s no willingness or no desire to create change, we do need to protect ourselves”, says Suzy.“Whether that’s refining boundaries or saying: ‘I\\'m sorry, I need to call time on this relationship’, we need to clearly articulate what it is that we need to feel safe and healthy in the relationship with that person.“It\\'s a matter of taking a look at those warning signs and just observing: Where are you at? Where are your energy levels at? Let\\'s give ourselves permission to pace ourselves.“So, it could be simple things like if you cannot extricate yourself from each other\\'s lives, there might be some boundaries around how we communicate. For example, ‘it\\'s not going to be endless messages’ or ‘we\\'re not going to talk about our emotional lives’. The nature of that communication needs to be targeted too – being clear on what\\'s OK and what\\'s not OK.”“Where possible, limit exposure and give yourself permission to choose who it is that you spend time with”, says Suzy. “In terms of that decision making.

[2023]. To address this, multi-agent strategies have emerged as a promising method\\nto enhance LLM reasoning. Using multi-agent strategies, multiple specialized agents collaborate,\\nwith each agent assigned distinct roles in the problem-solving process. By allowing different agents\\nto tackle various aspects of a task, we they are able to utilize specialized expertise to each phase of\\nthe task to improve performance Guo et al. [2024]. This has been shown to improve the quality of\\nanswers in reasoning-intensive domains. However, despite the promise of multi-agent reasoning, one\\nPreprint. Under review.\\narXiv:2409.11527v1  [cs.AI]  17 Sep 2024\\ncritical limitation remains: Reasoner agents often explore reasoning paths shallowly, failing to fully\\nconsider the complexity of the problem space. Tree of Thoughts (ToT) methods offer a potential\\nsolution to this limitation by encouraging a more systematic exploration of multiple reasoning paths.\\nToT allows LLMs to simulate human-like thought processes by branching out and examining various\\npossibilities before converging on a solution Yao et al. [2023]. By enabling LLMs to consider diverse\\nreasoning pathways, ToT can mitigate the shallow exploration issue seen in some other multi-agent\\nsystems. However, while ToT encourages exploration, it also introduces a new challenge: the risk of\\ngenerating flawed reasoning branches. Without proper validation, these erroneous paths could lower\\nthe overall trustworthiness of the final answer.\\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of multi-agent\\nreasoning with ToT while introducing a critical validation mechanism. In our framework, multiple\\nReasoner agents operate in parallel, each employing ToT to explore different reasoning paths. These\\nReasoner agents are supported by a Thought Validator agent, which evaluates the proposed reasoning\\nbranches produced by the Reasoners. The Validator discards faulty reasoning branches, ensuring that\\nonly logically sound paths contribute to the final decision. This approach allows for both exploration\\nof the problem space and increased reliability of the answers by eliminating flawed reasoning paths\\nbefore they can impact the outcome. Our proposed approach is evaluated on the GSM8K dataset\\nCobbe et al., a benchmark known for its challenging arithmetic reasoning tasks. Results show that\\nour method outperforms existing techniques, demonstrating improved accuracy and trustworthiness\\nin solving complex reasoning problems.\\nOur key contributions are as follows:\\n• The integration of ToT into a multi-agent reasoning framework.\\n• The introduction of a novel Thought Validator agent that evaluates and filters reasoning\\nbranches produced by Reasoner agents.\\n• Experimental results on the GSM8K dataset demonstrating improved accuracy and perfor-\\nmance in complex arithmetic reasoning tasks compared to existing techniques.\\n2\\nBackground\\n2.1\\nMulti-agent Systems for Enhancing LLM Reasoning\\nBy distributing tasks among multiple agents, multi-agent systems aim to improve performance on\\nreasoning-based tasks Du et al., Talebirad and Nadiri. For example, CausalGPT Tang et al. introduces\\nevaluative layers to verify the reasoning branches produced by LLMs, while the Counterfactual\\nMulti-Agent Debate (CFMAD) framework Fang et al. provides an innovative method to mitigate\\nthe potentially biased reasoning branches of LLMs by assigning agents to fixed roles to generate\\njustifications from specific perspectives, and a third-party judge evaluates these arguments to decide\\nthe most rational outcome. Despite these advancements, current methods still suffer from shallow\\nsampling of reasoning paths or majority vote schemes. These techniques can overlook critical inferen-\\ntial errors and are especially prone to early-stage errors, which can propagate through multiple rounds\\nof reasoning. This limitation is especially problematic in complex scenarios where systematically\\nevaluating and eliminating incorrect options is crucial. Recent research has demonstrated that LLMs\\ncan effectively identify both factual and inferential mistakes Li et al., making the integration of a\\ndedicated verification component in multi-agent systems particularly beneficial for assessing the\\nfaithfulness and reliability of generated solutions.\\n2.2\\nThe Role of the ’Reasoner’ Agent in Multi-Agent Frameworks\\nWithin multi-agent architectures, the Reasoner agent plays a pivotal role. It serves as the system’s core\\ndecision-maker, ensuring that valid conclusions are derived from the reasoning process. However,\\nReasoner agents in current frameworks often struggle to systematically evaluate and eliminate\\nincorrect reasoning paths, particularly in more challenging problem spaces. This bottleneck highlights\\nthe need for more advanced reasoning strategies to be integrated into the Reasoner agent. CFMAD\\nhas also shown that checking all available options can enhance the overall ability of the multi-agent\\nsystems Fang et al..\\n2\\nFigure 1: The process starts with a query being processed by multiple Reasoner agents. Each Reasoner\\nagent explores various reasoning paths using the ToT strategy, which includes decomposition of\\nthought steps, generation of paths, state evaluation, and path selection. The Thought Validator agent\\nthen evaluates the proposed reasoning branches, followed by a consensus-based voting mechanism.\\nIf consensus is not reached, a new reasoning round is initiated with feedback incorporation.\\n3\\nMethod\\nWe propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework that integrates the ToT strategy with a robust\\nvalidation mechanism to enhance complex problem-solving. Our approach employs multiple con-\\ncurrent Reasoner agents, each using ToT to explore diverse reasoning paths. At each tree level, a\\nstate evaluation agent scores the generated reasoning, with the highest-scored reasoning expanded in\\nthe subsequent level. Upon reaching the final tree level, each Reasoner agent produces a proposed\\nreasoning chain composed of the chain of the highest-scored reasoning in the tree. These reasoning\\nbranches are then independently assessed by a Thought Validator agent to either validate or invalidate\\nthe proposed reasoning. We then use a consensus-based voting mechanism, where verified reasoning\\npaths contribute to the vote, and invalidated ones are abstained. If consensus is not reached, we\\ninitiate a new reasoning round, incorporating feedback from the Thought Validator on the reasoning\\nbranch to refine the next reasoning round. Our proposed framework is illustrated in Figure 1.\\n3.1\\nReasoner Agent\\nThe Reasoner agents in our multi-agent architecture employ the ToT strategy, which enables structured\\nexploration of reasoning paths in parallel. ToT improves upon Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting Wei\\net al. by enabling parallel exploration and dynamic path evaluation. While CoT follows a single,\\nlinear path, ToT actively explores and evaluates multiple reasoning paths, making it better suited\\nfor complex problems that benefit from diverse thought exploration Yao et al.. We formalize the\\nreasoning process as a search over a tree of states. Let Q denote the input prompt or query, and each\\nReasoner agent Ri constructs a Tree of Thoughts Ti(Q), where each node represents a state st, which\\nis a distinct point along a reasoning path. A state st consists of the problem Q and a sequence of\\nintermediate reasoning steps up to that point z1, z2, . . . , zt, with each step zj being a coherent unit of\\nreasoning generated by the language model.\\nst = [Q, z1, z2, . . . , zt]\\nStep 1: Decomposition and Generation of Thought Paths\\nThe process is decomposed into intermediate thought steps using LLM prompting. For each state\\nst, the next potential thought zt+1 is generated by the Thought Generator G(pθ, st, k), where pθ\\ndenotes the language model. The Reasoner agents explore multiple branches from any given state st,\\ncorresponding to different continuations of the reasoning process. This approach ensures that the\\nexploration process covers a diverse range of possible solutions, avoiding the linearity of CoT and\\nallowing reconsideration of earlier steps.\\nStep 2: State Evaluation and Path Selection\\nTo evaluate each state st, we introduce a state evaluation agent that assigns a score to the generated\\nreasoning. This evaluation can be implemented through prompting, where the state evaluation agent\\nassesses the quality and potential of each reasoning step. At each tree level, the highest-scored\\nreasoning is selected for expansion in the subsequent level. This process continues until the final tree\\n3\\nlevel is reached. The selection mechanism can be formalized as:\\ns∗\\nt+1 = arg max\\nst+1 V (pθ, st+1)\\nwhere V (pθ, st+1) is the evaluation score assigned by the state evaluation agent.\\nStep 3: Reasoning Branch Construction\\nUpon reaching the final tree level, each Reasoner agent constructs a proposed reasoning chain. This\\nchain is composed of the highest-scored reasoning steps from each level of the tree. Formally, the\\nreasoning branch Ci for Reasoner Agent Ri can be represented as:\\nCi = [z,\\n1z,\\n2 . . . , z∗\\nT ]\\nwhere z∗\\nt is the highest-scored reasoning step at level t of the tree.\\n3.2\\nThought Validator Agent\\nThe Thought Validator agent, inspired by the role of a teacher providing feedback to students, plays\\na crucial role in assessing the validity of the reasoning branches produced by the Reasoner agents.\\nMuch like a teacher helping students refine their answers, this agent independently evaluates each\\nproposed reasoning branch to either validate or invalidate it. For each reasoning branch Ci, the\\nThought Validator agent performs several key steps. It begins with a logical consistency check to\\nevaluate the internal logic and coherence of the reasoning chain, similar to how a teacher might\\nassess a student’s argument. This is followed by a factual accuracy assessment to verify any factual\\nclaims made within the reasoning, akin to a teacher fact-checking a student’s work. Finally, the agent\\nconducts a completeness evaluation to ensure that the reasoning branch adequately addresses all\\naspects of the original query, much as a teacher would ensure a student’s response fully answers the\\nquestion. Through this comprehensive process, the Thought Validator agent ensures the robustness\\nand reliability of the reasoning branches, ultimately helping to improve the quality of the final output.\\nBased on these assessments, the Thought Validator assigns a binary validation status Vi to each\\nreasoning chain:\\nVi =\\n\\x1a1\\nif Ci is validated\\n0\\nif Ci is invalidated\\nConsensus-Based Voting Mechanism\\nAfter the validation process, we employ a consensus-based voting mechanism to determine the\\nfinal outcome. Only validated reasoning branches contribute to the vote, while invalidated ones are\\nabstained. The consensus solution S∗can be represented as:\\nS∗= arg max\\nS\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nVi · δ(S = Si)\\nWhere Si represents the solution derived from reasoning branch Ci, Vi is the validation status of Ci,\\nδ is an indicator function that returns 1 if the solutions match and 0 otherwise, and N is the total\\nnumber of Reasoner agents.\\n3.3\\nIterative Refinement\\nIf consensus is not reached (i.e., no solution receives a majority of validated votes), we initiate a new\\nreasoning round. This refinement process incorporates feedback from the Thought Validator on the\\nreasoning branches to guide the next iteration. This iterative process continues until consensus is\\nreached or a predefined maximum number of iterations is exceeded.\\n4\\nExperiments\\nDataset: GSM8K Cobbe et al. is a dataset of 8.5K high-quality linguistically diverse grade school\\nmath word problems created by human problem writers. GSM8K is widely recognized as a benchmark\\nfor testing arithmetic reasoning in LLMs. The dataset comprises complex, multi-step mathematical\\nword problems that challenge both the reasoning and computation capabilities of LLMs. Our\\n4\\nMethod\\nGpt-3.5-turbo\\nGpt-4o-mini\\nLlama3.1-8B\\nLlama3.1-70B\\nStandard IO\\n60.0\\n91.2\\n75.4\\n93.0\\nCoT\\n68.0\\n89.2\\n76.0\\n89.4\\nToT\\n75.4\\n91.6\\n80.2\\n92.8\\nMA ToT with Thought Validator\\n84.2\\n92.2\\n89.0\\n94.8\\nTable 1: Performance comparison of our Multi-agent ToT Reasoner with a Thought Validator\\ncompared to other LLM reasoning methods on the GSM8K reasoning dataset, evaluated across\\ndifferent LLMs.\\nexperiments utilized a random subset of 500 samples from the GSM8K dataset as the test set.\\nFollowing other works on LLM reasoning on the GSM8K dataset, we evaluated the performance of\\nreasoning approaches using accuracy as the primary metric Yao et al. [2023].\\nImplementation Details: Our experiments cover two versions of OpenAI’s GPT models and two\\nversions of Meta’s Llama 3.1 models Dubey et al. [2024]. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5 Turbo OpenAI\\n[2024b] and GPT-4o-mini OpenAI [2024a] from OpenAI, accessed through their API. For the Llama\\n3.1 models, we employ the 8B NousResearch [2024b] and 70B NousResearch [2024a] parameter\\nvariants. These models offer a range of capabilities and sizes, allowing us to explore different\\ntrade-offs between model complexity and performance in our experiments. We conduct all of our\\nexperiments on four Nvidia DGX A100 80 GB GPUs, and running all these experiments in parallel\\ntook about 18 hours. For our baseline comparisons, we employed several prompting strategies. We\\nbegan with input-output (IO) prompting, a standard approach that transforms a problem input into\\nan output by conditioning on task instructions. We then implemented more advanced techniques,\\nincluding Chain of Thought (CoT) Wei et al. and the original ToT strategy Yao et al. [2023]. For\\nthe ToT implementation, we followed the parameters used by Yao et al. [2023] on the GSM8K\\ndataset, setting a tree depth of 2 and a width of 5. To ensure consistency across our baseline models,\\nwe used a temperature of 1 and a top_p value of 1 for IO, CoT, and ToT. However, for our novel\\nThought Validator Agent, we adjusted these parameters to a temperature of 0.5 and a top_p of 0.4.\\nThis adjustment was made to increase the determinism of the Thought Validator’s outputs, as its role\\nis to validate existing reasoning rather than generate creative solutions.\\nExperimental Results:\\nTable 1 shows the performance comparison of these different methods. Our results show that our\\nproposed multi-agent ToT reasoner with a Thought Validator agent outperforms the other reasoning\\nmethods, showing an improvement of 8.8 percentage points over ToT for GPT-3.5-turbo (from 75.4%\\nto 84.2%). We also see that while ToT and other techniques showed significant improvements over\\nstandard IO prompting when the LLM struggled with a task (such as with GPT 3.5 Turbo and Llama\\n3.1 8B), the performance gap narrowed considerably for problems where the model with standard\\nIO prompting already exhibited strong capabilities (such as with GPT 4o mini, and Llama 3.1 70B).\\nThis observation suggests that the efficacy of ToT may be dependent on the complexity of the task\\nand capability of the model, with its benefits more pronounced in challenging reasoning tasks that\\npush the boundaries of the model’s baseline abilities. The effectiveness of ToT in these scenarios can\\nbe likened to a teacher providing feedback to a struggling student, guiding them through complex\\nproblems, and reinforcing correct thought processes.\\n5\\nLimitations and Conclusion\\nWhile the ToT approach has shown promise in enhancing reasoning capabilities, our observations\\nof the outputs and reasoning trees revealed several limitations that warrant further investigation. A\\nkey challenge we observed is the lack of dynamic exploration in the search space. The ToT method\\nproposed by Yao et al. [2023] employs a fixed width and depth for the tree structure, which our analysis\\nshowed can lead to suboptimal performance in certain scenarios. For instance, when examining the\\nreasoning trees for problems that could be solved efficiently without extensive reasoning, we found\\nthat the predetermined depth of exploration often introduced unnecessary complexity, potentially\\nleading to errors or confusion in the reasoning process. Conversely, for problems requiring more\\nin-depth analysis, we observed that the fixed depth proved insufficient, limiting the model’s ability to\\nfully explore complex reasoning paths. Additionally, our proposed approach, while addressing some\\n5\\nof these limitations, is computationally expensive due to the use of the ToT method, which requires\\nsignificant resources for generating and evaluating multiple thought paths.\\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel approach that combines the ToT strategy with a multi-agent\\nreasoning framework enhanced by a Thought Validator agent. Our method addresses key limitations\\nin existing reasoning strategies for LLMs by enabling a more systematic exploration of reasoning\\npaths while simultaneously improving the reliability of generated solutions. Experimental results on\\nthe GSM8K dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly\\nfor complex arithmetic reasoning tasks.\\n6\\nSocial Impact Statement\\nBy improving the depth of reasoning and enabling more systematic option elimination, our approach\\ncould lead to more trustworthy AI applications. However, these advancements also raise ethical\\nconsiderations regarding the deployment of highly autonomous reasoning systems, particularly in\\nhigh-stakes domains. It is essential to carefully manage the use of such systems to avoid over-reliance\\non AI, ensuring that human oversight and accountability remain integral to decision-making processes.\\nAdditionally, the broader societal implications must be monitored to prevent unintended consequences,\\nsuch as biases being amplified through algorithmic decision-making or the replacement of human\\nexpertise in fields where nuanced judgment is required.\\nReferences\\nKarl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser,\\nMatthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John\\nSchulman.

Here are the key prompts used and their purposes:\\nStandard Input-Output (IO) Prompt\\nThe standard IO prompt is used as a baseline approach:\\nAnswer the following math problem. Your response should\\nconclude with \"the answer is n\", where n is a number:\\n{input}\\nThis prompt directly asks the model to solve the math problem and provide the answer in a specific\\nformat.\\nChain of Thought (CoT) Prompt\\nThe CoT prompt encourages the model to show its reasoning:\\nAnswer the following question: {input}\\nMake a strategy, then write. Your output should be in\\nthe following format:\\nStrategy:\\nYour strategy about how to answer the question.\\nAnswer:\\nYour answer to the question. It should end with\\n\"the answer is n\", where n is a number.\\nThis prompt explicitly asks the model to formulate a strategy before providing an answer, leading to\\na more structured thought process.\\n7\\nTree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompt\\nOur implementation of ToT is inspired by the approach described by Yao et al. [2023] but with\\nspecific modifications tailored to our multi-agent framework. The ToT method uses the CoT prompt\\nas a base and applies it iteratively, allowing for branching and exploration of multiple reasoning paths.\\nOur implementation includes the following components:\\n1. Thought Generation: We use the ’sample’ method for generating thoughts. This method\\nuses the CoT prompt as a base but applies it iteratively, allowing for branching and explo-\\nration of multiple reasoning paths. The prompt flow for ToT includes:\\nAnswer the following question: {input}\\nMake a strategy, then write. Your output should be in\\nthe following format:\\nStrategy:\\nYour strategy about how to answer the question.\\nAnswer:\\nYour answer to the question. It should end with\\n\"the answer is n\", where n is a number.\\n2. State Evaluation: For evaluating the generated thoughts, we employ the ’vote’ method.\\nThis involves using a prompt to assign votes to different reasoning paths:\\nGiven an instruction and several choices, decide which\\nchoice is most promising. Analyze each choice in detail,\\nthen conclude in the last line \"The best choice is {s}\",\\nwhere s the integer id of the choice.\\n3. Path Selection: We use the ’greedy’ method for selecting the most promising paths to\\nexpand further. This doesn’t involve a specific prompt but rather selection of the highest-\\nscored paths from the evaluation step.\\nEach step involves multiple API calls to the language model, with the generated thoughts and their\\nevaluations guiding the exploration of the reasoning space. This approach allows for a dynamic and\\nadaptive exploration of potential solution paths, enhancing the model’s ability to tackle complex\\nreasoning tasks.\\nVerifier Prompt\\nA crucial component of our approach is the Thought Validator agent, which uses the following\\nprompt:\\nAs a critical mathematical reasoning verifier, evaluate\\nthe following thought process, which builds upon previous\\nsteps to reach a final conclusion. Focus on:\\n1. **Question Relevance**:\\n- Ensure the entire reasoning process directly\\naddresses the original question.\\n- Check if the final answer actually solves what\\nwas asked.\\n2. **Reasoning Progression**:\\n- Assess logical flow and consistency, especially\\nin final steps.\\n- Verify mathematical operations’ correctness and\\nappropriateness.\\n- Identify logical fallacies or unjustified leaps.\\n8\\n3. **Factual Accuracy**:\\n- Check accuracy and relevance of facts and numbers,\\nparticularly in final calculations.\\n- Spot any misuse of mathematical concepts.\\n4. **Completeness**:\\n- Ensure all necessary aspects are addressed,\\nparticularly in concluding thoughts.\\n- Identify significant omissions that could affect\\nthe result.\\n5. **Critical Assessment**:\\n- Actively seek potential errors or weak points.\\n- Don’t hesitate to invalidate reasoning if\\nsignificant issues are found.\\nProvide a holistic evaluation of the entire reasoning\\nprocess, from start to finish. Conclude with\\n\"Reasoning is Valid\" only if the entire process is\\nrelevant, logically sound, and error-free. Otherwise,\\nconclude with \"Reasoning is Invalid\" and briefly\\nexplain why.\\nThis comprehensive prompt guides the Verifier in thoroughly assessing the validity of the reasoning\\nprocess, ensuring that the final answer is not only correct but also logically sound and relevant to the\\noriginal question.\\nExamples\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show a challenging example from the GSM8K\\ndataset using the gpt-3.5-turbo model. Using this example, we can see how the Thought Validator\\nAgent prevents incorrect reasoning from the ToT Reasoner agents from leading to errors in the final\\nanswer.\\nProblem 1: Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week,\\nshe mowed Kamala’s lawn three times as many times as Joe’s. The following week, she mowed Alba’s\\nlawn five times as Joe’s. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade\\nsales? Answer: 26.\\nWe have three rounds, each involving three Reasoner agents (R1, R2, and R3). After each round, the\\nThought Validator Agent evaluates their reasoning.\\nReasoner\\nReasoning Summary\\nFinal Answer\\nVerified\\nR1\\nIncorrect reasoning. Algebraic error leads to the incorrect\\nconclusion that Tasha did not mow Joe’s lawn.\\n$80\\nFalse\\nR2\\nCorrect strategy, but incorrect total earnings from mowing\\nlawns ($60x instead of $48x).\\n$80\\nFalse\\nR3\\nAccurate reasoning. Correctly calculates the total earnings\\nfrom mowing lawns and finds lemonade income to be $26.\\n$26\\nTrue\\nTable 2: (Round 1) Reasoner Outputs and Verification Status\\nRound 1 Analysis\\nIn Round 1, Reasoner 1 (R1) incorrectly calculated that Tasha did not mow Joe’s lawn, leading to\\nan invalid final answer of $80. Reasoner 2 (R2) correctly identified the structure of the problem but\\nmade a calculation error, arriving at $80. Reasoner 3 (R3) provided the correct reasoning and final\\nanswer of $26, which was verified as valid. However we have not reached an agreement since the\\nonly valid answer is the R3 response.\\n9\\nRound 1 Conclusion: No Consensus Reached.\\nReasoner\\nReasoning Summary\\nFinal Answer\\nVerified\\nR1\\nRepeated the previous error, miscalculating Tasha’s in-\\ncome from lawn mowing.\\n$80\\nFalse\\nR2\\nCorrected earlier miscalculation but again used the wrong\\nmowing total, leading to an incorrect conclusion.\\n$80\\nFalse\\nR3\\nMaintained the correct reasoning and final answer ($26)\\nas in Round 1.\\n$26\\nTrue\\nTable 3: (Round 2) Reasoner Outputs and Verification Status\\nRound 2 Analysis\\nIn Round 2, Reasoner 1 (R1) repeated its earlier algebraic mistake. Reasoner 2 (R2) adjusted its\\ncalculations but still produced an incorrect final answer. Reasoner 3 (R3) again provided the correct\\nreasoning and final answer of $26.\\nRound 2 Conclusion: No Consensus Reached.\\nReasoner\\nReasoning Summary\\nFinal Answer\\nVerified\\nR1\\nCorrects earlier algebraic error, but still does not address\\nthe lemonade sales correctly.\\n$80\\nFalse\\nR2\\nAdjusts previous mistake but there is a slight issue in the\\nfinal calculation but the Validator Agent was not able to\\ndetect it.\\n$32\\nFalse\\nR3\\nMaintained the correct reasoning and final answer ($26)\\nas in Round 1.\\n$26\\nTrue\\nTable 4: (Round3) Reasoner Outputs and Verification Status\\nRound 3 Analysis\\nIn Round 3, Reasoner 1 corrected its earlier algebraic errors but still provided an invalid answer ($80).\\nReasoner 2 finally corrected its calculations, but still has a small issue in final answer and reach to\\n$32. Reasoner 3 remained consistent and accurate, providing the correct answer of $26.\\nFinal Conclusion: Most frequent valid answer is $26. Final answer: 26\\nProblem 2: Bob is in charge of doing laundry for a large hotel. Each room has two sheets, one\\ncomforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases. How many\\npieces of laundry are there in 80 rooms? Answer: 26.\\nReasoner\\nReasoning Summary\\nFinal Answer\\nVerified\\nR1\\nAccurate breakdown of laundry items per room and multi-\\nplication across 80 rooms. Correct total of 1200 pieces of\\nlaundry.\\n1200\\nTrue\\nR2\\nCCorrect approach, but overestimated the number of pil-\\nlowcases, leading to an incorrect total of 1280 pieces of\\nlaundry.\\n1280\\nFalse\\nR3\\nCorrect breakdown of laundry per room, yielding the cor-\\nrect total of 1200 pieces of laundry.\\n1200\\nTrue\\nTable 5: (Round 1) Reasoner Outputs and Verification Status\\nRound 1 Analysis\\nIn Round 1, the Thought Validator Agent evaluated the responses from all three Reasoners. Both\\nReasoner 1 (R1) and Reasoner 3 (R3) provided correct and consistent reasoning, each arriving at\\n10\\nthe total of 1200 pieces of laundry, which was validated as accurate. However, Reasoner 2 (R2)\\noverestimated the number of pillowcases, leading to an incorrect answer of 1280 pieces, which was\\nmarked as invalid.\\nSince two verified Reasoners (R1 and R3) agreed on the correct answer, the final result of 1200 pieces\\nof laundry was confidently returned.\\nRound 1 Conclusion: At least two verified reasoners agree. Final Answer: 1200\\n11\\n')"
